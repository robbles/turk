Turk - the software framework for interfacing devices and desktop software to
web applications.  Using XMPP (Jabber) IM accounts and the simple Turk XMPP
protocol, this framework lets you create and automatically run simple plugins
that interface devices and desktop software to web applications. Includes
built-in support for interfacing to Digi XBee modules, serially connected
Arduinos or similar microcontroller devices, and MIDI instruments.

A simple explanation of how the framework works is as follows:

* You develop a driver plugin that interfaces to your device/application/widget, written in any language that has bindings for D-Bus (pretty much any)
* You create a web application that can send XMPP messages (this can be done easily with PHP, Python, or even Javascript!)
* Create two XMPP accounts on any server, one for the platform and one or more for your apps
* Change the config file to use your XMPP accounts and start your driver (or start them remotely from the app!)
* Run Turk!

NOTE: You need dbus and python-dbus installed first. If there's no precompiled package for your system, get them from:
